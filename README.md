> *"Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to trolling."*

## 🌟 What is this?

A minimalist, retro-styled website that serves as a digital manifesto for the internet's most misunderstood creatures: **trolls**. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of chaos.

## 🎨 Features

- ✨ **Retro aesthetic** - Because the 90s called and they want their design back
- 🐱 **Nyan Cat animation** - Because why not?
- 🖤 **Dark theme** - Because light mode is for normies
- 📱 **Responsive design** - Works on everything from your grandma's flip phone to your neighbor's smart fridge
- ♿ **Accessible** - Even screen readers can appreciate the chaos
